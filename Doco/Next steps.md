Create a global configuration system:
Central .env files for each environment - If working with Dokploy env files are held inside of the app GUI. How would this work?
Shared configuration templates
Secrets management with Docker Secrets or external tools - Prefer Github secrets where possible

2. Deployment Automation Scripts - perfect, I like it.
Build on your existing monitoring scripts:
Stack deployment scripts with validation
Health check automation
Rollback procedures
Backup automation before deployments - Backblaze backups to b2 storage. Could build on Duplicacy for this?

3. Infrastructure Validation
Compose file linting and validation
Automated testing of service connectivity
Resource usage monitoring and alerting - Want good options for this. Grafana and Promethius where a bit of a let down.
Suggested IaC Evolution Path

Phase 1: Enhance Current Setup
Standardise environment management
Create deployment scripts for all stacks
Add infrastructure validation
Implement proper secrets management

Phase 2: Add Automation Layer
Ansible playbooks for cluster management
CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
Infrastructure monitoring and alerting
Automated backup and recovery

Phase 3: Advanced IaC
Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
GitOps workflows with automatic deployments
Multi-environment management (dev/staging/prod)
Infrastructure testing and compliance


## Suggested Implementation Order
### Phase 1A: Quick Wins (Next 2 weeks)
Create deployment scripts using your webhook URLs
Set up GitHub Actions for automated deployments
Implement Netdata for better monitoring
Extend Duplicacy for pre-deployment backups

### Phase 1B: Configuration Management (Following 2 weeks)
Hybrid env management - GitHub secrets + Dokploy API
Compose file validation in CI/CD
Health check automation post-deployment
